A panel of tools for Exodus CSEs

This provides a panel of nifty stuff which makes the CSE's life a lot easier. Automating tedious tasks like composing xpub
Javascript commands for the developer console, opening up ShapeShift order pages and JSON output, etc.

The panel floats above your desktop, and can be placed anywhere so you can be as productive as possible.
